A grouplet, like any social group with a mission, needs to organize. With a
lightweight structure in place to facilitate communication, coordination, and
collaboration, a small group can achieve a tremdous impact.

### Commitment model

[commitment model]: #commitment-model

Borrowed from [The Rainbow of Death][RoD] ([CC-BY-4.0][]), the "commitment
model" explains how to distribute responsibilities effectively across a range of
volunteers according to their level of availability:

[RoD]:  https://mike-bland.com/the-rainbow-of-death
[CC-BY-4.0]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US

* **Core**: Core members define the vision for accomplishing the mission, assume
  major responsibilities and drive major initiatives, and communicate to other
  volunteers the roles they can fill to execute on important parts of the
  operation.
* **Partial**: Partially-committed members assume important, if not major roles,
  to ensure that ongoing tasks are consistently fulfilled over the long-term.
  Whereas core members function strategically, partially-committed members
  function tactically, driving regular activities that ensure momentum is
  created, maintained, and amplified.
* **Occasional**: The majority of volunteers will be occasionally involved,
  offering their time and energy as they can, when they can, to drive the
  mission forward.  While not as committed as the other levels, their actions
  are critical to creating widespread, tangible, lasting change

Here’s how these commitment levels looked in reality for the Google Testing
Grouplet:

* **Core**: The core group consisted of the Testing Grouplet leads and active
  core members; [Fixit][] organizers and core team members recruited to fulfill
  specific roles; and the coordinators of the Testing on the Toilet and Test
  Certified programs.
* **Partial**: The partially-committed volunteers consisted of regular Testing
  on the Toilet reviewers and posters, Test Certified mentors, and local Fixit
  Instigators that acted as Fixit organizers for each of their offices.
* **Occasional**: Many other volunteers wrote Testing on the Toilet episodes,
  Codelabs, or other documentation; gave Tech Talks on specific testing
  concepts, tools, or techniques; or did their part during Fixit events to
  improve their own team’s tests and practices.

In order for grouplet initiatives to become successful, they require a balance
of all three types of commitment from volunteers across the organization. No
matter how much time and energy someone has to give, a grouplet must have a
struture and activities that can make the best use of it.

### Roles

[roles]: #roles

Though a grouplet leader (usually) isn't in a formal supervisory role over other
grouplet members, there's still a strong need to establish a basic, functional
team structure in order to orient members within the group and provide a channel
for their creativity. However, rather than adopting a heavy-handed
command-and-control style, have fun with the role names!

As an example, here is a prospective list of roles—and no, you may not need
_all_ of them, at least not right away or all the time:

**The Walrus (Organizer):** **Mike Bland**{: style="color: green;"}<br/>
Assumes ownership of the overall effort. Responsible for: establishing
direction and priorities, delegating tasks, removing obstacles, and getting
their hands dirty when needed.

**Prime Mover (Project Manager):** **Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>
Ensures that tasks are assigned and executed, reserves the meeting room, manages
remote coordination, ensures that the Historian’s minutes are posted in a timely
manner.

**Historian (Archivist):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>
Responsible for documenting, summarizing, and archiving notable issues or
activities and their artifacts in a centrally-accessible repository (such as the
[home page][]). Meeting minutes fall under this rubric, as to retrospectives to
ensure valuable lessons are recorded for the benefit of future generations.

**Minister of Information (Documentation Coordinator):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>
Solicits and helps cultivate documentation, technical and otherwise, in support
of the grouplet's mission.

events. Responsible for the design and distribution of promotional material.

**Minister of Communication (Communication Coordinator):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>

useful, and broadly used by the group. May suggest alternate communication media
or innovative uses of the media already in use.

them engaged, making sure they’re equipped with flyers and other propaganda, and
responding to their requests and concerns.

**Local Instigators (Office Contacts):**<br/>

who ensure the sense of engagement with the main grouplet.

**Mayor of Jonestown (Occasional Volunteer Coordinator):**

well-communicated.

contributions, in ways large and small.

**Schwagmeister (Prize Coordinator):**

**Wordsmith (Content Designer):**

content, for example the use of tags, application of CSS styles, traditional SEO
techniques for organizing content and making it more easily discoverable.

**Festmeister (Event Planner/Manager):**

**Field Commander (War Room Coordinator):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>

technical issues, and where participants can walk in to seek assistance.

**Damned Liar (Statistician):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>
Collects metrics on the grouplet's impact, and that of its events and specific
initiatives, and makes it sound like the numbers actually mean something.

**Minister of Phynance (Accountant):**
**Mike Bland**{: style="color: red;"}<br/>
Secures funding and manages the budget for schwag and prizes.

### Probability of success

Notice the number of roles with the organizers' names next to them in red. You
can point [recruits][] at this list when pitching them, or during the [kick-off
meeting][], and explain this:

> **The grouplet's long-term chances of success are inversely proportional to
> the number of Roles that have the organizers' names next to them in red!**

People can quickly see where help is most needed and jump in accordingly.

### Sense of efficiency

The prospective separation of responsibilities as defined in the [two-pager][]
give prospective [recruits][] a sense that the team is (or will become)
well-organized and efficient. Keeping the actual titles fun sends a message that
the group is not about piling additional work onto people for the sake of the
organizer's personal ambition.

### Distribution of responsibilities

[distribution of responsibilities]: #distribution-of-responsibilities

Good roles serve two critical functions: delegation and escalation. The
Organizers _should not_ be the only ones responsible for every detail of the
overall effort.

There need not be a one-to-one correspondence between roles and individuals. One
person can serve more than one role, and one role can be filled by more than one
person. The important part is that the functions and those responsible for them
are made clear.

### Distribution of communication

Also, when responsibilities are clear, grouplet members may be able to manage
tasks by going directly to the appropriate role-holder, rather than the
organizers having to remain in the critical path of every decision. In other
words, "creativity is pushed towards the edge of the organization". (Need
"Technical Impact" citation.)

### Efficiency eliminates guilt

Given an understanding of the [commitment model][] and the [distribution of
responsibilities][], it's possible to design a grouplet to take maximum
advantage of the time and energy that people can afford to contribute at any
given time. More specifically:

> **No one should feel the need to apologize for letting the grouplet down when
> other priorities demand their attention!**

While volunteer participation is always greatly appreciated, if the grouplet
fails to maintain momentum because some individuals need to focus on other
things for a while, that's the fault of the grouplet leads, not the volunteers.

It's the grouplet leads' job to ensure that the grouplet maintains some degree
of forward momentum given fluctuating degrees of volunteer availability—and it's
the goal of this guide to give grouplet leads the tools they need to achieve
that.
