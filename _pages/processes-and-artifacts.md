### The two-pager

[two-pager]: #the-two-pager

When faced with the task of forming a new grouplet, a very useful exercise is to
write a two-page document describing the [mission][] of the grouplet, its
[Objectives and Key Results][], and the initial set of [roles][] that will form
the grouplet's basic structure. This two-pager helps to clarify your thinking
and course of action, and serves as an effective [recruiting][] artifact, as
prospective volunteers can get a feel for the grouplet very quickly and see how
they may be able to pitch in and contribute right away.

### The mission statement

[mission]: #the-mission-statement

It should go without saying that there should be a one-sentence mission
statement describing why the grouplet should exist. It's the reason for starting
a grouplet in the first place; if you can't articulate that reason clearly, then
maybe the grouplet shouldn't exist. It's also the first item in your
[recruiting][] toolkit, as it will be the first thing at the very top of your
[two-pager][] artifact.

Here are a few examples:

- **Documentation Grouplet:** Organize all the organization’s information and
  make it universally accessible and useful, internally and externally.
- **Testing Grouplet**: Ensure the long-term success of development projects by
  cultivating the best automated testing tools, practices, and training
  materials available.
- **Intergrouplet**: To create an environment in which grouplets can thrive and
  have a meaningful impact on deliverables and operations.

### Objectives and Key Results

[Objectives and Key Results]: #objectives-and-key-results
[OKRs]:                       #objectives-and-key-results

The Objectives and Key Results (OKR) process is a quarterly process for setting
goals and reviewing progress. It involves defining roughly three-to-five
high-level strategic objectives that support the team's overall [mission][], and
defining a number of key results that implement each objective and serve to
demonstrate measurable progress. Ideally most of these are framed in terms of
problems to solve, not specific features to build; this enables grouplet members
to devise their own creative solutions.

At the end of the quarter, the team will review and self-grade each OKR, as well
as the OKRs overall, on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. The "ideal" score is **0.7**,
which is indicative of a "stretch goal": a goal that was beyond the team's
reach, but pushed the team to accomplish more than they would have given a more
conservative goal.

OKRs are designed to produce focus and enable calibration of expectations.
Self-grading is a feedback process; a low grade doesn't necessarily denote
failure, nor does a high grade denote success. The process serves to ensure the
team is moving in the direction of its own choosing, and making satisfactory
progress according to its own ambitions.

When prospective [recruits][] see a set of OKRs in your [two-pager][], they can
better understand the priorities and begin to imagine how the grouplet can
succeed in acheiving its goals. This boosts your credibility as a leader, as
someone who will ensure that their limited time is well-spent in the context of
the grouplet.

As an example, here are propspective OKRs for the Testing Grouplet:

- **Objective: Respond to the automated testing needs and priorities of
  products.**
  - **KR:** Survey existing projects to determine current state of automated
    testing.
- **Objective: Effectively disseminate knowledge of automated testing best
  practices.**
  - **KR:** Complete a full review of the Automated Testing Playbook.
  - **KR:** Develop a Test Certified-like program and recruit three projects to
    participate.
  - **KR:** Develop a body of in-house training materials.
- **Objective: Develop, maintain, and promote use of automated testing tools.**
  - **KR:** Publish an Automated Testing Handbook with tools and technical
    details for specific scenarios.

_(Note: At Google, every individual, team, and department maintains a set of
quarterly OKRs, as does the entire company.)_

### MacGuffin

[MacGuffin]: #macguffin

"[MacGuffin][McG]" is the film industry term for an object that drives the
action of the plot. In _Pulp Fiction_, it's Marsellus Wallace's suitcase. In
_Raiders of the Lost Ark_, it's the Ark of the Covenant. It's handy to have a
MacGuffin at the outset of the grouplet as well.

[McG]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin

A MacGuffin provides [recruits][] with tangible proof that the grouplet exists
and _is up to something._ It should be an artifact that invites cultivation and
can grow along with the grouplet itself, and can provide the foundation for one
or more of the grouplet's initial [Objectives and Key Results][]. Some examples:

- **Testing Grouplet**: [The Automated Testing Playbook][atp]
- **Intergrouplet**: [The Grouplet Guide][gp]

### Recruiting

[recruiting]: #recruiting
[recruits]:   #recruiting

So you've defined a [mission][], broken out [Objectives and Key Results][],
defined fun-sounding [roles][], started implementing a [MacGuffin][], and
encapsulated all of this into a [two-pager][]. Now you're ready to shop around
for prospective grouplet members!

There are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there's still time to
change the road you're on:

- **One-on-one**: Set up brief appointments with prospective recruits to engage
  them in-person. Walk them through the [two-pager][] and ask for their thoughts
  and opinions. If they seem into it, recruit them into one or more of the
  available [roles][].
- **Broadcast**: Send the [two-pager][] out to a broad audience and respond to
  any bites. Follow up with one-on-one invitations, or announce the initial
  [kick-off meeting][] at the same time.

### Kick-off meeting

[kick-off meeting]: #kick-off-meeting

With your [two-pager][] in-hand, use it as the official agenda for the first
kick-off meeting. Ideally you've already had a one-on-one [recruiting][] chat
with most of the people in the room; this ensures that the meeting goes quickly,
and that other people besides the organizers have a chance to speak about some
of their own ideas.

### Weekly meetings

[weekly meetings]: #weekly-meetings
[weekly meeting]:  #weekly-meetings

After the warm fuzzies of the initial [recruiting][] phase and the [kick-off
meeting][] have worn off, it's critical to maintain momentum and team cohesion
by holding brief weekly meetings, ideally only thirty minutes. Though modern
professionals have grown very wary of meetings, when run well, they are the best
tool in the box for making sure people continue to identify with the grouplet
and feel a sense of constant forward progress.

That said, it's incumbent upon the organizers to ensure these meetings are run
as well as possible. There should be a grouplet [task list][] that is reviewed
every week. The organizers should draft a one-page [agenda][] and publish it at
least one day prior to each meeting to give people an idea of the week's
business and to provide the opportunity to put new items on the agenda. To make
the best use of everyone's time, the organizers should impress upon members that
everyone should come prepared to discuss the items for which they're
responsible.

One of the most important things to keep in mind: _take turns talking!_ No one
wants to be lectured at by any sort of leader for one minute, let alone thirty.
Do what you can to foster healthy, dynamic discussion between grouplet members,
_even if that means biting your tongue when no one will speak up!_ If you let
the group get used to you breaking all of the silences, it will gladly let you
continue to do so.

### Task list

[task list]: #task-list

The grouplet should maintain a centralized task list to keep track of all the
different efforts underway, large and small. The beginning of each [weekly
meeting][] should be a very quick review of this list; items should be added to
it as necessary during the remainder of the meeting.

The point of the task list isn't to make members feel guilty for the tasks
they've not made progress on; as a volunteer effort, one should expect grouplet
tasks will often fall onto the backburner given higher-priority tasks from
members' officially-assigned projects. The point is to ensure that good ideas
and promising action items aren't forgotten, and to make a habit of celebrating
those items that are completed, so that members feel like their efforts are
recognized and appreciated.

Tracking tasks like this can also be useful for writing weekly status reports or
personal [snippets][], as concrete reminders of tangible progress.

[snippets]: https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/12/17/snippets/

A sharable medium for the list is best; this can be as basic as a shared
spreadsheet, or a full-blown issue tracker or project management program such as
[Trello][] or [JIRA][].

### Weekly agenda

[agenda]: #weekly-agenda

Publishing a one-page weekly agenda is one of the most important items for
ensuring [weekly meetings][] remain focused. Members who attend should read the
agenda ahead of time, know clearly what to expect during the course of the
meeting (in terms of structure, if not detail), and come prepared to discuss any
items for which they're responsible. If something they would like to discuss is
not on the agenda, they should be free to add it. The historian can then use the
agenda document to keep the meeting minutes, which will help reflect how closely
the meeting stuck to the intended structure.

A sharable document works best for this, naturally, but an imperfect something's
better than nothing. A recommended structure for the document is:

- A link back to the previous week's agenda document
- A link to the grouplet's [task list][]
- Top-level agenda items, possibly followed by supporting comments or artifacts
- A spot for "other business" at the end, where the historian can note other
  topics that may have arisen during the meeting

### Breakout meetings

Sometimes topics will arise that are too large to discuss during the course of
the [weekly meeting][]. Rather than let the [agenda][] fall by the wayside, it's
good practice to announce a breakout meeting to discuss one specific item. These
meetings can actually be much longer than the weekly meeting, since they will
usually engage fewer people who are particularly interested in the outcome of a
single issue. Those who attend the meeting will be expected to take notes or
produce some other resulting artifact to present at the following weekly meeting
of the entire grouplet.

It's not always necessary for the organizers to be at every breakout meeting.
Given a cohesive [mission][], set of [Objectives and Key Results][],
well-defined [roles][], and a well-maintained [task list][], it's possible that
a subset of members are aligned and motivated enough to hold their own special
meeting without oversight. This is actually healthy for the grouplet, as members
see themselves as autonomous contributors within a community of peers, rather
than mere followers of the organizers. It's also a chance for members to takes
turns driving meetings and initiatives before inheriting the organizer role one
day.

### Artifacts, assumptions, and measurable outcomes

Developed by Nick Brethauer, this exercise is about evaluating the assumptions
behind the key results component of the [Objectives and Key Results][] process.
Create a table with three columns:

- **Doing/Building this:** A key result action or artifact
- **Will get us this outcome:** The intended impact of the key result
- **We'll know we're right when we see:** The measurable outcome of the key
  result that demonstrates the intended impact

Here are a couple of examples:

* **[Using Slack emoji reactions to automatically file documentation
  issues][sei]**<br/>
  **will** help us cultivate high-quality documentation.<br/>
  **We'll know we're right when** Guides receive frequent page views and people
  spend less time asking and answering questions in Slack.
* **Moving some kinds of content from the wiki into Guides**<br/>
  **will** make standard information more accessible and useful.<br/>
  **We'll know we're right when** people indicate the Guides are the first place
  they look for standard information and that their questions are usually
  answered by them.

### Chat room

If it's convenient, having an online chat room in which members can discuss
grouplet business and make announcements is a great way to foster community
and make progress in between meetings. It's also a great way to ensure that
members distributed across multiple work sites remain fully-integrated into
pertinent discussions. [Slack][] is a very popular chat room system.

[Slack]: https://slack.com

### Home page

The home page should be an information radiator that enables grouplet members to
share and discover information easily. It can take the form of an actual web
page, a shared drive, a wiki page, a chat room channel, an issue tracker, a
project management tool, or some combination of these tools and others.

### Fixits

[Fixits][] are traditionally one-day sprints where people are asked to put aside
normal project work and focus on "important but not urgent" tasks. They are
also fantastic for rolling out new tools across an organization.

[Fixits]: https://mike-bland.com/2011/10/04/fixits.html

In practice, fixits can be of any length and size. Organizing or participating
in a fixit has many important side-benefits in addition to the stated goals of
the fixit itself:

- Fixits focus both organizers and participants on concrete goals that
  contribute to an overall strategic objective.
- Motivation for participation can take the form of prizes for participation,
  recognition for good deeds, and a sense of good karma from doing the right
  thing.
- Fixits punctuate the larger "story arc" of overall culture-change with
  exciting events that raise the morale of everyone involved, thanks to all
  the positive energy that's generated.
- Fixits often advance the state-of-the-art by focusing energy and momentum to
  push beyond a tipping point, ratcheting the overall culture-change effort up
  to a new plateau.

[Roles][] are especially powerful for organizing and generating momentum for a
fixit. It was [Mike Bland's experience organizing his second Testing Fixit at
Google][fixit-2007] that inspired the "Roles" concept.

### Exit strategy

A healthy grouplet doesn't depend on the vision and effort of one or two
people. As an organizer, you should start scouting for a successor on day one.
Cultivating members to rise up through the ranks helps the grouplet remain
vibrant and active, and will one day free you to move on to new challenges
with the comfort of knowing that the team you helped to build continues to
thrive.
