title: Intergrouplets
---
An intergrouplet is a grouplet of grouplet leads. Once the grouplet concept
starts taking hold in an organization, it is critical to institute an
intergrouplet to ensure that people have a positive, productive experience,
rather than burning out on the idea due to a lack of guidance and support.

Its function is not to give each of the grouplets direct orders, but to foster a
community that:

* provides mentorship to new grouplet leaders
* shares challenges and develops solutions common to all grouplets
* coordinate between grouplets to avoid event conflicts and the like
* encourages collaboration between grouplets to further their respective
  missions
* promote groupleteering across the organization

Just like a regular grouplet, an intergrouplet may draft a [two-pager][],
develop [OKRs][], assign [roles][], and the like.

[roles]:     {{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/processes-and-artifacts.md %}#roles
[OKRs]:      {{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/processes-and-artifacts.md %}#objectives-and-key-results
