Grouplets are teams of volunteers that address concerns affecting a broad
segment of the organization.

They are usually self-forming, although they may occasionally be initiated by
managers and executives. They often have no authority and few, if any, direct
resources. It's incumbent upon grouplets to recruit volunteers and make the best
use of their time.

This guide aims to provide aspiring grouplet organizers with a "bag of tricks" for:

* Getting a grouplet organized and productive very quickly
* Maintaining team cohesion over time
* Understanding the various forces at play in an organization
* Making the undertaking high-impact and fun

Mike's talk [The Rainbow of Death][RoD] and his (very) long-form article [Goto
Fail, Heartbleed, and Unit Testing Culture][GFHB] contains many more details and
examples regarding the Google Testing Grouplet's effort to drive adoption of
automated testing, upon which much of this advice is based.
