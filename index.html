title: Introduction
---
<p>Grouplets are teams of volunteers that address concerns affecting a broad
segment of the organization.</p>

<p>Leaders are emergent from the group, not recruited by HR or promoted by
managers and executives. They often have no authority and few, if any, direct
resources. It's incumbent upon them to recruit volunteers and make the best use
of their time.</p>

<p>
This guide aims to provide aspiring grouplet organizers with a "bag of tricks" for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting a grouplet organized and productive very quickly</li>
<li>Maintaining team cohesion over time</li>
<li>Understanding the various forces at play in an organization</li>
<li>Making the undertaking high-impact and fun</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide contains content also found in the <a

and examples regarding the Google Testing Grouplet's effort to drive adoption
of automated testing, upon which much of this advice is based.</p>
